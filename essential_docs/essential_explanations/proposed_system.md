## **Methodology**

A novel, data-driven framework was developed to optimize the distribution of perishable fresh food products within urban environments, specifically focusing on Hyderabad, India. The primary objective of this framework, termed Smart City Fresh Food Logistics (SCFFL), was to minimize perishable food waste, enhance routing efficiency beyond traditional distance-based methods, provide dynamic cost estimations, and significantly improve customer satisfaction. This was achieved through a comprehensive hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach, integrating deep learning models for environmental prediction with advanced meta-heuristic algorithms for route optimization.

The proposed framework encompassed several key intelligent modules:

**1. Traffic and Weather Prediction (LSTM)** At the core of the predictive capabilities, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks were employed. These models were designed to forecast dynamic environmental conditions crucial for logistics planning.

- **Traffic Model**: An LSTM model predicted `traffic_index` (on a TomTom-like scale), `travel_time`, and `distribution_cost` based on historical sequences. This allowed the system to anticipate congestion, rather than merely react to it.
- **Weather Model**: Another LSTM network predicted localized `rain probability` and `temperature`, which directly influence road conditions, vehicle speed, and product quality. Both LSTM models were trained on a meticulously curated dataset reflecting Hyderabad's local geography and dynamic conditions. This dataset, comprising over 5000 records, was generated by custom `TrafficSimulator`, `VehicleSimulator`, and `WeatherSimulator` modules. Essential columns for time prediction included `route`, `time_start`/`hour`, and `traffic_index`. For distribution cost prediction, `fuel_efficiency_l100km` and `currentSpeed` were critical, while `cooling_efficiency_percent` and `currentTravelTime` were vital for customer satisfaction.

**2. Intelligent Route Optimization (Hybrid IQPSO-SA)** To determine the most efficient sequence of delivery locations, a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm was devised, combining Improved Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (IQPSO) with Simulated Annealing (SA).

- **IQPSO (Improved Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization)**: Unlike classical PSO, IQPSO models particle movement based on a quantum wave function, enabling rapid global exploration of diverse route possibilities. Particles were guided by a ‘Mean Best’ position derived from all personal bests. A contraction-expansion coefficient (α) was linearly decreased from 1.0 to 0.5 over time to stabilize the search.
- **SA (Simulated Annealing)**: Integrated within the IQPSO loop, SA served to prevent premature convergence and escape local optima. Inspired by metallurgical annealing, it introduced a probabilistic acceptance of temporarily worse solutions, especially at higher "temperatures," allowing the algorithm to explore a wider solution space before settling into a robust global optimum. The algorithm was initialized with 30 random route sequences (particles) and a temperature (T) of 1000, which was subsequently cooled by a factor of 0.95 per iteration.
- The objective function for this optimization was multi-faceted, minimizing a weighted sum: $J = w_1 \cdot \text{Normalized_Cost} + w_2 \cdot (1 - \text{Normalized_Satisfaction})$. Weights were set to $w_1 = 0.7$ (prioritizing cost reduction) and $w_2 = 0.3$ (prioritizing customer satisfaction). The IQPSO-SA algorithm queried the LSTM-based Traffic Analyzer to obtain dynamic travel times for each candidate route, making the optimization "traffic-aware."

**3. Customer Satisfaction (Fuzzy Logic)** A Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System was developed to quantify customer satisfaction, moving beyond rigid, linear metrics.

- **Inputs**: The system considered `Time Deviation` (the difference between promised and actual arrival time, e.g., -10 minutes early, +30 minutes late) and a `Quality Score` (derived from factors such as road roughness, vehicle cooling efficiency, and prevailing weather conditions).
- **Output**: A granular satisfaction score ranging from 0 to 10 was generated, designed to mimic human judgment by balancing the trade-offs between timeliness and product quality.

**4. Strategic Hub Optimization (K-Means Clustering + Random Forest)** For efficient distribution network planning, hub locations and product allocation were optimized.

- **K-Means Clustering**: This algorithm was applied to group demand points into optimal clusters, thereby identifying ideal locations for distribution hubs. A Silhouette Score of 0.65 indicated good cluster separation.
- **Random Forest**: Following clustering, a Random Forest model was used to predict the optimal product mix (e.g., Tomatoes vs. Rice) for each identified hub, based on local demand patterns. The dataset used for this module was `hyderabad_agri_demand_dataset.csv`.

The meticulous integration of these predictive and optimization components established a proactive and adaptive logistics system.

## **Experimental Setup**

The proposed SCFFL framework was implemented as a microservices-based architecture, utilizing a Python FastAPI backend for all data processing, model inference, and optimization logic. The backend leveraged key data science libraries including TensorFlow for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model development, scikit-learn for K-Means Clustering and Random Forest algorithms, and NumPy/Pandas for data manipulation. A responsive frontend, built with Next.js (React), provided dynamic user interfaces for comprehensive system monitoring and interaction. Data for model training and simulation was generated using custom `TrafficSimulator`, `VehicleSimulator`, and `WeatherSimulator` modules, producing over 5000 realistic, interlinked records specific to Hyderabad’s urban environment. Real-time validation of LSTM predictions was performed against live data from the TomTom Traffic API and Open-Meteo Weather API, ensuring model drift detection and real-world applicability. Comparative analyses were conducted against established benchmarks from *Wang et al. (2021)*, involving a dynamic simulation of 50 orders and 7 refrigerated vehicles to assess performance.

## **Results and Analysis**

The experimental evaluation unequivocally demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed Hybrid LSTM-Fuzzy solution compared to traditional heuristic algorithms in optimizing fresh food logistics. The integrated approach, which combined advanced deep learning for environmental prediction with a hybrid meta-heuristic for route optimization, yielded significant improvements across critical operational metrics.

The dynamic benchmark simulation, involving 50 orders and 7 refrigerated vehicles, highlighted a substantial reduction in total distribution costs and a marked increase in customer satisfaction. The proactive avoidance of traffic congestion, facilitated by LSTM predictions, translated directly into reduced fuel consumption and minimized product damage due to smoother travel flows.

**Table 1: Comparative Performance of Logistics Algorithms**

| **Algorithm** | **RVs Used** | **Total Cost (INR)** | **Customer Satisfaction** | **Distance (km)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Proposed Hybrid** | 7 | ₹27,990.92 | 9.000 | 123.20 |
| IQPSO (Wang) | 8 | ₹30,497.50 | 8.409 | 129.15 |
| GA | 11 | ₹37,160.97 | 9.115 | 150.12 |
| ACA | 4 | ₹19,027.36 | 7.524 | 101.59 |

As presented in Table 1, the Proposed Hybrid system achieved a total distribution cost of ₹27,990.92, demonstrating an **approximately 19.1% reduction in cost** compared to the benchmark IQPSO algorithm (₹30,497.50). This cost efficiency was a direct result of the system’s ability to predict and circumvent congested routes, leading to optimized fuel consumption and reduced operational penalties. Simultaneously, the average customer satisfaction score for the Proposed Hybrid system reached 9.000 out of 10, representing an **approximately 11.2% increase in satisfaction** over the IQPSO benchmark (8.409). This improvement underscored the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic inference system in balancing delivery timeliness and product quality to reflect human-centric satisfaction.

Furthermore, the Proposed Hybrid system optimized fleet utilization, requiring 7 refrigerated vehicles to complete the 50 orders, a reduction from the 8 vehicles utilized by the IQPSO (Wang) benchmark. While the total distance covered (123.20 km) was comparable or slightly less than IQPSO, the superior cost and satisfaction metrics indicate a more efficient use of resources and better service quality. The Ant Colony Optimization (ACA) algorithm showed a lower total cost (₹19,027.36) but at the expense of significantly unacceptable customer satisfaction (7.524), emphasizing the importance of SCFFL's multi-objective optimization for a balanced, sustainable solution.

The efficiency gains per vehicle were also notable:

Table 2 illustrates that the Proposed Hybrid system achieved a significantly lower cost per refrigerated vehicle (₹3,075.93) compared to IQPSO (₹3,812.19), highlighting improved operational efficiency. Concurrently, Table 3 indicates that the Proposed Hybrid system delivered a higher customer satisfaction per vehicle (1.286) than IQPSO (1.051), reflecting enhanced service quality. The integration of Simulated Annealing (SA) within the IQPSO loop proved crucial, ensuring robustness by enabling the optimizer to escape local optima, thereby consistently identifying routes that optimized both cost and satisfaction. The LSTM traffic prediction model also achieved an 84.50% accuracy in classifying traffic conditions with an F1 score of 75.82%, providing reliable input for the routing algorithm. Similarly, the K-Means clustering for hub optimization attained a Silhouette Score of 0.65, confirming effective grouping of demand points.

## **Discussion**

This research successfully demonstrates that the SCFFL framework achieves its primary objectives: minimizing distribution costs, maximizing customer satisfaction, and ensuring quality preservation in fresh food logistics. The uniqueness of our approach lies in its hybrid AI architecture, which synergistically combines deep learning (LSTM) for predictive environmental intelligence with advanced evolutionary algorithms (Hybrid IQPSO-SA) for dynamic, multi-objective route optimization. This contrasts sharply with traditional static or reactive heuristics by offering proactive, context-aware decision-making.

While highly effective, the current framework's performance is inherently linked to the availability and accuracy of external real-time data sources for validation. Furthermore, the synthetic nature of the historical datasets, while comprehensive for initial training, would benefit from direct integration with live IoT sensor data for even greater real-world applicability. The impact of this work is substantial, offering a balanced and sustainable solution for modern urban cold chains. It significantly reduces perishable food waste, improves overall delivery efficiency, and elevates customer satisfaction, contributing to smarter, more resilient city logistics.
