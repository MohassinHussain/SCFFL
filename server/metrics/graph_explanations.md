# Analysis of Results

This section presents the performance evaluation of the proposed system, including the accuracy of the traffic prediction model, the efficiency of the optimization algorithm, and the overall improvements in cost and customer satisfaction.

## 1. Traffic Prediction Model Performance (LSTM)

**Graph:** `lstm_performance.png`

The performance of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for traffic index prediction is illustrated in **Figure 1**. The scatter plot compares the *Actual Traffic Index* (x-axis), derived from historical data, against the *Predicted Traffic Index* (y-axis) generated by the LSTM model on the test dataset.

*   **Observation**: The data points cluster tightly around the diagonal red dashed line, which represents perfect prediction accuracy ($y=x$).
*   **Analysis**: This strong correlation indicates that the LSTM model effectively captures complex temporal dependencies in traffic patterns, such as peak hours, seasonal variations, and day-of-week trends. The low deviation suggests minimal error, ensuring reliable inputs for the subsequent routing optimization module.

## 2. Optimization Algorithm Convergence

**Graph:** `iqpso_vs_hybrid.png`

**Figure 2** compares the convergence characteristics of the standard Improved Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (**IQPSO**) versus the proposed **Hybrid IQPSO with Simulated Annealing (IQPSO+SA)**. The x-axis represents the number of iterations, while the y-axis shows the objective function value (a composite metric of total distribution cost and delivery time).

*   **Observation**: The standard IQPSO (orange dashed line) shows slower convergence and plateauing at a higher objective value. In contrast, the Proposed Hybrid algorithm (green solid line) demonstrates a steeper descent in the early iterations and converges to a significantly lower final objective value.
*   **Analysis**: The integration of Simulated Annealing (SA) allows the algorithm to escape local optima by accepting worse solutions with a certain probability in the early stages. This exploration capability leads to finding a more globally optimal routing solution compare to the benchmark IQPSO, directly translating to reduced operational costs.

## 3. Multi-Hub Optimal Routing Visualization

**Graph:** `routing_optimization.png`

**Figure 3** visualizes the optimal multi-depot vehicle routing solution generated by the proposed system for the Hyderabad region.

*   **Structure**: The network utilizes two primary distribution hubs: **Mehdipatnam (Central Hub)** and **Uppal (East Hub)**, marked with red triangles.
*   **Routing Logic**: The system dynamically assigns retail locations (blue dots) to the nearest or most cost-effective hub. Optimised routes (colored lines) are constructed to form closed loops that start and end at the respective hubs.
    *   *Route 1 (Green)* covers the West Zone (Gachibowli, HITEC City).
    *   *Route 2 (Purple)* services the North Zone (Kompally, Medchal).
    *   *Route 3 (Orange)* and *Route 4 (Brown)* handle the Central and South-East dense clusters.
*   **Significance**: This multi-hub approach reduces the "last-mile" distance for individual vehicles compared to a single-depot system, ensuring faster deliveries and balanced fleet utilization.

## 4. Cost Efficiency Analysis

**Graph:** `cost_comparison.png`

**Figure 4** presents a comparative analysis of the **Distribution Cost per Retail Vehicle (RV)** between the benchmark IQPSO system and the proposed Hybrid system.

*   **Observation**: The proposed system achieves a significantly lower cost per delivery unit.
*   **Analysis**: By optimizing route sequences to avoid congestion (using LSTM predictions) and utilizing closer distribution hubs, the proposed system reduces fuel consumption and vehicle wear-tear. The cost reduction is approximately **32%**, demonstrating the economic viability of the proposed solution for large-scale logistics operations.

## 5. Customer Satisfaction Analysis

**Graph:** `satisfaction_comparison.png`

**Figure 5** illustrates the **Customer Satisfaction Score** (on a scale of 0-10) achieved by both systems.

*   **Observation**: The proposed system registers a higher satisfaction score compared to the benchmark.
*   **Analysis**: Customer satisfaction in this model is inversely proportional to delivery delay. The improved prediction accuracy and efficient routing ensure that perishable goods reach retailers well within the required time windows, leading to fresher stock and higher reliability scores (approx. **9.4/10** vs **7.2/10**).
