TESTING GUIDE FOR /OVERALL DASHBOARD
====================================

This guide outlines the steps to verify the functionality of the System Intelligence & Diagnostics page.

1. MODEL DIAGNOSTICS
--------------------
Step 1: Locate the "Model Performance Diagnostics" section at the top.
Step 2: Click the "Run System Diagnosis" button.
Step 3: Wait for the loading spinner to complete.
Step 4: Verify that two cards appear:
    - "TRAFFIC PREDICTION MODEL (LSTM)": Should show Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
    - "WEATHER IMPACT MODEL (LSTM)": Should show similar metrics.
    *Pass Criteria*: Both cards display non-zero percentage values (e.g., Accuracy > 70%).

2. INTELLIGENT ROUTE OPTIMIZATION (Hybrid IQPSO-SA)
---------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Locate the "Intelligent Route Optimization" section.
Step 2: Click the "Run Hybrid Optimization" button.
Step 3: Wait for "Optimizing Routes..." to complete.
Step 4: Verify the results:
    - "Optimized Sequence": A list of locations (e.g., 1. Kompally ⬇ 2. Medchal...).
    - "Total Estimated Duration": A value in minutes (e.g., 145.2 min).
    - "Improvement": A green percentage (e.g., 12.5% Faster) vs the initial random route.
    - "Algorithm Performance":
        - "Cost Convergence": A bar chart showing the cost decreasing over iterations.
        - "Algorithm Strategy": Should read "IQPSO-SA Hybrid (Quantum PSO + Simulated Annealing)".
    *Pass Criteria*: Valid sequence is returned, and improvement percentage is shown.

3. LIVE DELIVERY SIMULATOR
--------------------------
Step 1: Scroll to the "Live Delivery Simulator" section.
Step 2: Input Test Data:
    - Route Name: Select "Kompally (North)" or "Gachibowli".
    - Start Time: Select a time (e.g., "09:00" for peak, "14:00" for off-peak).
    - Distance: Enter "10" (km).
Step 3: Click "Simulate Delivery".
Step 4: Verify the Dashboard Metrics:
    - "Model Estimate": Should show LSTM predicted duration.
    - "Real-time Accurate": Should show TomTom's live duration (if API key is valid) or N/A.
    - "Model Accuracy": The % match between Model and Real-time.
    - "Detailed Metrics": Check Predicted Traffic Index, Predicted Rain, Live Temp, and Current Speed.
    - "Raw TomTom Response": (Optional) Click/View JSON if available to check API connection.

TESTING SCENARIOS
-----------------
Scenario A (Peak Traffic):
- Select "Gachibowli", Time "09:00" or "18:00".
- Expect: Higher Traffic Index (>60), Lower Speed, Longer Duration.

Scenario B (Free Flow):
- Select "Medchal" or "Outer Ring Road", Time "03:00".
- Expect: Low Traffic Index (<20), High Speed, Shorter Duration.

Scenario C (Rain Check):
- If the Weather Model predicts rain (non-zero rain mm), verify that speeds are slightly impacted.

---------------------------------------------------
Ensure `uvicorn main:app --reload` and `npm run dev` are running before testing.
