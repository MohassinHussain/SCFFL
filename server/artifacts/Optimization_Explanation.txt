IQPSO + SA OPTIMIZATION & SYSTEM INTEGRATION
==============================================

1. IS THE TRAFFIC ANALYZER MODEL OPTIMIZED USING IQPSO?
-------------------------------------------------------
No. The Traffic Analyzer (LSTM Model) is NOT being "trained" or "hyperparameter-tuned" by the IQPSO algorithm. 
Instead, the IQPSO algorithm *USES* the Traffic Analyzer as an intelligent "Cost Calculator".

- **Traffic Analyzer (LSTM)**: Its job is to PREDICT travel time based on time/weather.
- **IQPSO Optimizer**: Its job is to FIND THE BEST ROUTE sequence using those predictions.

Think of it this way: The LSTM is the "GPS" that estimates time, and the IQPSO is the "Navigator" that tries thousands of route combinations to find the fastest one using that GPS.

2. IS THERE ANY EFFECT OF IQPSO + SA ON THE TRAFFIC RESULTS?
------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, but in terms of *Application* rather than *Model Weights*.
- The IQPSO algorithm queries the `traffic_analyzer.predict()` function thousands of times (simulated) to evaluate candidate routes.
- By using the LSTM predictions (instead of static distance/speed math), the Optimization results are "Traffic-Aware". 
- Example: If the LSTM predicts high traffic at "Gachibowli" at 9 AM, the IQPSO algorithm will likely try to order the route to visit Gachibowli later in the day to minimize the total cost.

3. IS OPTIMIZATION WORKING? HOW?
--------------------------------
Yes, the optimization is actively working.
Code File: `server/models/optimization/iqpso_sa.py`

**How it works (Step-by-Step):**

A. **Initialization**: 
   The system creates 30 "Particles". Each particle represents a random delivery sequence (e.g., [Uppal, Kompally, Medchal...]).

B. **Evaluation (Fitness Function)**:
   For every particle (route), the algorithm calculates the "Total Travel Time".
   *Crucial Step*: To make this calculation, it calls the **Traffic Analyzer LSTM** (`traffic_analyzer.predict`).
   It asks: "How long will it take to go from Node A to Node B at this specific time?"

C. **Intelligent Evolution (IQPSO)**:
   The particles communicate. If Particle 5 finds a very fast route, other particles are mathematically "attracted" to that sequence (using Quantum Potential Well logic).

D. **Escaping Local Optima (Simulated Annealing)**:
   Sometimes, to avoid getting stuck in a "good but not perfect" route, the algorithm randomly "mutates" a route (swaps two locations). This is the Simulated Annealing part.

E. **Convergence**:
   After ~100 iterations, the particles converge on the single best sequence found. This result is sent to the UI.
