Traffic, Weather, and Overall System Analysis Walkthrough
I have implemented the traffic, weather, and overall system analysis features, providing deep insights via LSTM models and a live delivery simulator.

Feature Overview
1. Overall System Analysis Page (/overall)
System Diagnostics: Trigger simultaneous analysis of both Traffic and Weather models.
Advanced Metrics: Displays sophisticated classification metrics derived from the regression models:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score: Calculated by thresholding predictions (e.g., Traffic > 60 is High Congestion).
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes prediction performance.
Live Delivery Simulator:
Predicts Estimated Delivery Time, Traffic Index, and Weather Impact for specific routes and distances.
Uses live model inference based on the current server time.
2. Traffic Analysis Page (/traffic)
Run Deep Analysis: Triggers traffic model training and shows Loss/MAE.
Visualizations: Displays key traffic KPIs like Peak Hours and Conversion Rates.
3. Weather Analysis Page (/weather)
Analyze Weather Models: Triggers weather model training.
Impact Assessment: Shows how current weather affects delivery delays and order volume.
Verification
Automated Prediction Test
Verifying the /overall/predict_delivery endpoint:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"route_name": "Gachibowli", "range_km": 15.0}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/overall/predict_delivery
Result:

{
  "route": "Gachibowli",
  "distance_km": 15.0,
  "predicted_traffic_index": 50.0,
  "predicted_rain_mm": 0,
  "estimated_delivery_time_mins": 51,
  "conditions": {
    "congestion": "Low",
    "weather": "Clear"
  }
}
How to Test
Navigate to the Traffic or Weather pages to run individual analyses.
Navigate to the Overall page.
Click "Run System Diagnosis" to see the classification metrics tables.
Use the "Live Delivery Simulator" form to estimate delivery times for different routes.
